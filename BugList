==List of currently identified UA3 bugs (for lack of a better way to communicate these)==

Ranked in order of importance:
===========================================================================
1. "Farmer Akma" mission fails to trigger/start in some cases.  Game stagnates with no new mission.

2. Cannot use skills/items while licked (Licker).

3. Kinetic Integrator is currently a usable item with zero cooldown, but it appears to have no effect.
Energy regen is still passive. 
CM MOS with EN SI and KI looked like energy was regenerating too quickly.  May need balance. Values should be double checked.

4. Reload bugs - TCP Police do not seem to auto reload.
Occasional player reload bugs.  This bug is possibly created by running out of ammo as a player MOS.

5. Unit life bar display options are locked to only show when damaged.  Is this intentional?
Makes missions like civilians at balaad, and thanatos much more difficult, though UI looks better IMO.

6. Terrain mesh too low?  Several low spots on the map have items and units "floating" above ground.

7. I had a report of AR marksmanship skill disabled after death/rev.  No more crits.

8. LN Frag grenades: "Cannot find placement location" on tree trunk terrain.

9. Jav rocket bug still exists (rockets fail to explode, dance, then zoom off in a different direction).

10. Longtime UA3 bug: NVG toggle in early game leaves scenery much darker than before powered on.
===========================================================================

That's all I've got so far.  Thanks a bunch to you guys for continuing to work on this.
If I have time, I'll see if I can figure out how to fix a few of these.
